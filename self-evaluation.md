# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
It is useful to break down an array into it's single elements and process them based on the code given. It can sort arrays into groupings that help filter and refine the array elements in to more detailed groupings perhaps, or to remove some elements that don't meet the criteria of the code given in the each method. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I still need to practice the challanges I didn't submit for the Loom challange and research the practice section parts I wasn't able to discover the answer to. I plan on researching them more but also reaching out to others to share info and hints on how to find these terms more easily. I seem to have trouble wording the search terms on some of them and maybe over thinking how to find them.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
I tried to not get hung up on one or two practice examples where I couldn't solve them and just move on or take a break for a second. It helped me not get stuck on one problem, rather than finishing the assignment.
